        <p>Electric bikes have gained a lot of popularity in the recent years, however saying that an electric bike is a new or recent concept is false. The technology used in an electric bike has been claimed for a patent by various developers since 1800s which means that it is an almost 120-year-old invention.</p>
        <h2>ELECTRIC BIKE MOTORS</h2>
        
        <P style="color:green;">An electrical bicycle or an e-bike is one that has attached to its rear end an electric motor. This motor helps or assists in pedaling and can thus be very useful for a rider. This is especially true for people who ride bikes uphill or other hard terrains that are difficult to navigate. When motorized bikes are built with electronically powered motors, they are called e-bikes.</P>
